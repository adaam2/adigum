# Santiagum 1.0

I made the adaptation and enhancements to the code and also some pretty little things on design.

## Installation
1. Grab a copy of Santiagum in your computer
2. Copy `santiagum` folder into `wp-content/themes/`
3. Activate Santiagum from WordPress Administration panel in Appearance > Themes menu

## Usage notes
This theme works as any other simple WordPress theme. Here's special notes for specific functionality:

* To attach an image to a post or page as cover photo (just like in Medium), just add the image to *Set featured image* option under post/page editing
* To stick posts under *Featured Posts* in home page, mark the post as *Sticky*. Do this by expanding *Visibility* option under post editing
* The author's avatar is taken from Gravatar
* There are two navigations: One of them in the left side pane of theme (through top-left corner logo) which contains search area, pages, categories and archives. And the other one is a quick navigation for most important links/pages or it could be act as shortcuts, it's located bellow blog name and tagline in home page. To activate and configure this navigation go to Appearance > Menus.

## Suggestions

* I suggest do not edit this theme, since I'll release enhancements over the next weeks and you could get the updates easily by pulling changes from this repo or by replacing the entire theme folder in your site
* Also, for a correct visualization in Santiagum, I suggest configure the media sizes in your WordPress as:
  * Medium: 700x900
  * Large: 1024x1024
  
## Support

All major browsers:

* IE8+
* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Opera
* Webkit Mobile Browsers

At any time you can add an **Issue** to this repo to notify bugs or broken things. I'll be watching for new issues to fix them as soon as I can. .gitmodulesS
