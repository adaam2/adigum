## Installation
1. Grab a copy of Santiagum in your computer
2. Copy `santiagum` folder into `wp-content/themes/`
3. Activate Santiagum from WordPress Administration panel in Appearance > Themes menu

## Usage notes
This theme works just like any other Wordpress theme. Just keep in mind:

* To attach an image to a post or page as cover photo (just like in Medium), just add the image to *Set featured image* option under post/page editing
* To stick posts under *Featured Posts* in home page, mark the post as *Sticky*. Do this by expanding *Visibility* option under post editing
* The author's avatar is taken from Gravatar
* There are two navigations: One of them in the left side pane of theme (through upper-left corner logo) which contains search area, pages, categories and archives. And the other one is a quick navigation for most important links/pages or it could be act as shortcuts, it's located bellow blog name and tagline in home page. To activate and configure this navigation go to Appearance > Menus.

## Suggestions

* This theme is in active development, so expect new releases over the next weeks. You can update it easily just by pulling the changes from this repo or by replacing the entire theme folder in your site. Since there are many enhancements coming, be careful when editing.
* Also, for a correct visualization in Santiagum, I suggest configure the media sizes in your WordPress as:
  * Medium: 700x900
  * Large: 1024x1024
  
## Support

* Language: Only available in English lang. The internationalization feature will come over the next few months
* Browser support: All major browsers
  * IE8+
  * Google Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Opera
  * Webkit Mobile Browsers

At any time you can add an **Issue** to this repo to notify bugs or broken things. I'll be watching for new issues to fix them as soon as I can.
