# Adigum 1.0 (based on the wonderful Santiagum theme)

Santiagum is a Medium-like theme for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), based on [Readium](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/) made by [Sven Read](http://www.svenread.com/) for [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org/) platform. This port tailored theme for WordPress comes with several improvements and some pretty little design extras.
